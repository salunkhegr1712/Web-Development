## position and the alignment on the web pages

factors:

        1) content is everything
          the things which you write in your web pages will determine the position accordingly understanding
          all other things are attached to each other and position of the one is can be determine on the
          basis of others

        2) Order
          the order on which you write the data will always matters and accordingly it will place another
          element output so order is important in sense of the position

        3) parent
          child always been place over the parent on z axis and parent lies on xy plane with respect
          to the child and most young one among the set of elements of parent and child will seen on top
          and second youngest and third youngest will positioned accordingly.


position functionalityin class

position :
          1) Static
          it is just like the original by default setting of the html values

          2) Relative

          so we see siblings here and position of siblings depends on one another
          sense of movement in relative mode

          sense of direction :

          div {
            position: relative
            top :x px; shift block to bottom by x pixels
            bottom: x px; shift block to top by x pixels
            left: x px; shift block to right by x pixels
            right: x px; shift block to left by x pixels
          }

          here overlapping is posible and and it is also possible that block can also
          go out of the screen / display. in it we just push the element and it generate
          possibility of push to dead end(out of the screen)

          3) Absolute
          here things gets to get more and more confusing
          absolute never push element to dead end
          so it breaks connection of a element with its sibling and directly connect it with the
          its parent and that element can now go whatever in webpage but with respect to its parent

          sense of direction :

        assumption::  img is prensent in div tag in html

          div {

            position: relative
            top :x px; place the block such that it is at distance of x pixel from top
            bottom: x px; place the block such that it is at distance of x pixel from bottom
            left: x px; place the block such that it is at distance of x pixel from left side
            right: x px; place the block such that it is at distance of x pixels from right side
          }

          img{
            position: absolute;
          }
          overlapping is posible but it is 2d when you see 3d the overlapping is not there as
          it has different z axis
          also here our element never goes out of the box

          4) Fixed
          ok so it is just simple that
          say
          Ex:
          div {
          position: Fixed;
          }

          so even if you scroll website the Fixedarea will alwaysbe Fixed and you cant change its
          location either it mostly used for fixed sidebars
