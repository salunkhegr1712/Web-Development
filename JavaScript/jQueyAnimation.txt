$("h1").hide(); it is used to hide a element
$("h1").show(); it is used to unhide a element
$("h1").toggle(); it will switch between show and hide

$("h1").fadeOut(); hide with some fading out effect
$("h1").fadeIn(); this will back the faded out element with some fadein effect

slideup and slide down to collapse and un collapse the element
