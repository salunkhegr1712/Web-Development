## Box-Model of html and css

there is block that is called as box model and every division follow it
example for text::

margin -> border -> padding -> text

you always have to adjust all four of the attributes for margin border so that it makes sense
for the understanding


// note : always try to use the inline-block as it provide much functions and inline also gave
lot of errors and problem and inline- block can save your time at that perticular instant
