##sizing of differnet elements in the CSS

you can provide css sizing in many ways but there are two main ways :
giving info in pixel or in percentage so the percentageway is better as you dont know the size and the aspect

so genrally no of pixels for the some percentage is always varies and it will never be constant

so always prefer to use percentage


## division
 it is also known as the div tag which most usefull one and you can use it whenever you want as we know that we follow the
 box model so div is block elements and it help allot in formatting and lot of other stuff also

if you provide the values in pixels so your website fail to deliver message as your main text look smaller than
unnecessary once
so to tackle that issue we use the dynamic sizing and it is allot helpfull than that of the normal once

px value directly will always give the static value
two ways to provide dynamic sizing:

 100 %=16px
 1em=16px

 em and also with the percentage amplify the size
 say you provide a font size of 2em inside the body
 and then you give another font size in h1 say 4 em so here the total size which the css will display will give
 is total 6em it basically add the  data you have given

 so now tackle this problem we got rem which is modification of em and here rem does not matter if size already given or not
