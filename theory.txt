there are two types of the elements are there in html
1) inline elements
  images <img>
  anchors <a>
  spans <span>

  these elements does not block anyone to written upfromt of them
  so we can use mulitple elements in same line with help of the inline
  demerit of them are that it do not have any width so you cant assign width to it
  and inline elements will show output of next elements upnext to previous inline

2) block elements

  division <div>
  pargraph <p>
  section <section>

  these tags will disallow to use the same block to any other element and it will block
  someone who came and try to write next to the block element and it have configurations like
  having width and height is its major advantages


display functionality in css
  if any tag  say
    p {
      display : inline;
    }

    so here above as you can see p is an block element but as we specfied the inline in
    the display it will act like an inline element

    attribute of display
    a) inline
    b) block
    c) inline-block
    d) none

    inline used to make element act like inline even if it is functionality
    ex :
          p {
            display : inline;
          }

    block used to make element act like block even if it is functionality
    ex:
        span {
          display: block;
        }
    inline-block is usefull that it has inline property and at the same time you will
    also will able to do adjustments in width and height

    ex:
        span {
          display: inline-block;
        }
    none will just hide output

    there is another way to hide the output

    element {
      visibility: hidden;
    }


there is block that is called as box model and every division follow it
example for text::

margin -> border -> padding -> text

you always have to adjust all four of the attributes for margin border so that it makes sense
for the understanding
