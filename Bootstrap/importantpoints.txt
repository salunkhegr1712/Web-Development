New in v5.2.0: Navbars can be themed with CSS variables that are scoped to the .navbar base class.
.navbar-light has been deprecated
and .navbar-dark has been rewritten to override CSS variables instead of adding additional styles.

nav is very similar to the div but nav is more specific and mainly used for creation of the navigation bar which is
our goal that to create a navigation bar
link used in navigation bar is designed with nav-link
items used in navigation bar is designed with nav-item
navbar-expand rotate vertical text to horizontal one  it also have some extra attribute like sm large and accordingly
used for device which youre going to work
bg-color will provide the colour

for the brand name we use class navbar-brand and it is more specific and a anchor tag is best for that purpose

as css has many classes so if you want to specify something must whichyou want to add in your code then
just add !important infront of it and it automatically get modified
