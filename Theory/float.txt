it is very important and usefull attribute which is used for sideby side showing you can use table
also but the table is kind of so much messy and float make it us easy to align the text and images sideby side

it has deafalut set of the values like the float to left right and few another with it

there is another attribute is there which acts like opposite of the float ::
clear it will push text or next block top new line
