the bootstrap cards are just like three layout card which has 3 main elements inside of it and it plays important
role in  many kind and it is also preety easy to use and it is also a simple to use elements

here for create the card we just use the three class card-body, card-header, card-footer inside the main
 class called card and all of the classes are presence in the div

 ex:


      <div class="card">
          <div class="card-header">
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
          </div>
          <div class="card-footer">
          </div>
      </div>

    so each of the sub div say header body footer all has a horizontal area to cover so in order to make the multiple cards at
    side-by-side view then you have use:
    class="card-group"
    and div block will look like::

    <div class="card-group">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-header">
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
            </div>
            <div class="card-footer">
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
