so you can have different kinds of conditions and according to that you want to make chanegs Insider your stylesheet
so here media queries will come to play

so say u have something say if scrren resolution is less 1000px so you want to gove look to page which look different
that of when its size is greater than 1000px

so media query exmaple is given below

@media (max-width:1000) {
  style
}

so if max width of your screen is below 1000 the style which yo will provide inside the media
query that will get implemented on top of that

you can also give the multiple conditions like

@media (max-width:1000) and (min-width:800){
code
}

so it will effective under the 800 to 1000 range

you should write media conditions at last in css because if you put it befaore happening incident of old event it
does not matter allot
