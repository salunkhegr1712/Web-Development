###  block and inline elements

there are two types of the elements are there in html
1) inline elements
  images <img>
  anchors <a>
  spans <span>

  these elements does not block anyone to written upfromt of them
  so we can use mulitple elements in same line with help of the inline
  demerit of them are that it do not have any width so you cant assign width to it
  and inline elements will show output of next elements upnext to previous inline

2) block elements

  division <div>
  pargraph <p>
  section <section>

  these tags will disallow to use the same block to any other element and it will block
  someone who came and try to write next to the block element and it have configurations like
  having width and height is its major advantages


display functionality in css
  if any tag  say
    p {
      display : inline;
    }

    so here above as you can see p is an block element but as we specfied the inline in
    the display it will act like an inline element

    attribute of display
    a) inline
    b) block
    c) inline-block
    d) none

    inline used to make element act like inline even if it is functionality
    ex :
          p {
            display : inline;
          }

    block used to make element act like block even if it is functionality
    ex:
        span {
          display: block;
        }
    inline-block is usefull that it has inline property and at the same time you will
    also will able to do adjustments in width and height

    ex:
        span {
          display: inline-block;
        }
    none will just hide output

    there is another way to hide the output

    element {
      visibility: hidden;
    }


## Box-Model of html and css

there is block that is called as box model and every division follow it
example for text::

margin -> border -> padding -> text

you always have to adjust all four of the attributes for margin border so that it makes sense
for the understanding


// note : always try to use the inline-block as it provide much functions and inline also gave
lot of errors and problem and inline- block can save your time at that perticular instant

## position and the alignment on the web pages

factors:

        1) content is everything
          the things which you write in your web pages will determine the position accordingly understanding
          all other things are attached to each other and position of the one is can be determine on the
          basis of others

        2) Order
          the order on which you write the data will always matters and accordingly it will place another
          element output so order is important in sense of the position

        3) parent
          child always been place over the parent on z axis and parent lies on xy plane with respect
          to the child and most young one among the set of elements of parent and child will seen on top
          and second youngest and third youngest will positioned accordingly.


position functionalityin class

position :
          1) Static
          it is just like the original by default setting of the html values

          2) Relative

          so we see siblings here and position of siblings depends on one another
          sense of movement in relative mode

          sense of direction :

          div {
            position: relative
            top :x px; shift block to bottom by x pixels
            bottom: x px; shift block to top by x pixels
            left: x px; shift block to right by x pixels
            right: x px; shift block to left by x pixels
          }

          here overlapping is posible and and it is also possible that block can also
          go out of the screen / display. in it we just push the element and it generate
          possibility of push to dead end(out of the screen)

          3) Absolute
          here things gets to get more and more confusing
          absolute never push element to dead end
          so it breaks connection of a element with its sibling and directly connect it with the
          its parent and that element can now go whatever in webpage but with respect to its parent

          sense of direction :

        assumption::  img is prensent in div tag in html

          div {

            position: relative
            top :x px; place the block such that it is at distance of x pixel from top
            bottom: x px; place the block such that it is at distance of x pixel from bottom
            left: x px; place the block such that it is at distance of x pixel from left side
            right: x px; place the block such that it is at distance of x pixels from right side
          }

          img{
            position: absolute;
          }
          overlapping is posible but it is 2d when you see 3d the overlapping is not there as
          it has different z axis
          also here our element never goes out of the box

          4) Fixed
          ok so it is just simple that
          say
          Ex:
          div {
          position: Fixed;
          }

          so even if you scroll website the Fixedarea will alwaysbe Fixed and you cant change its
          location either it mostly used for fixed sidebars
